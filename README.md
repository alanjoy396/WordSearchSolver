# WordSearchSolver
 It solves word searches for you!

This program can be used to solve word search puzzles, or puzzles where, given a rectangular grid of letters, you have to search for certain words. 

## Usage

After compiling it in your favorite C++ compiler, you have to give it two arguments when you run the program: a puzzle txt file containing the grid of letters, and a txt list of words to search for. Once you do this, the program will show you the puzzle again, as well as the coordinates for the first instance of each word.
